## 📌 Problem Statement
**Problem Statement 1:**  *Weave AI magic with Groq*

---

## 🎯 Objective

This project addresses the issue of information overload by delivering personalized, real-time news summaries based on individual preferences. In today’s fast-paced world, keeping up with the sheer volume of news can be overwhelming, and sifting through multiple sources to find what's relevant takes up valuable time. This tool caters to anyone seeking to stay informed without spending excessive time, be it professionals, students, or casual readers wanting to stay current on specific topics.
By using Groq’s compound-beta AI, which integrates web search and code execution tools, the system delivers accurate, up-to-date news in a concise format. With advanced Llama models for precise responses, it provides an ideal solution for users wanting to stay informed while avoiding information overload. Whether you're a professional or someone who enjoys curated content, this tool helps save time by delivering only the most relevant news.

## 🧠 Team & Approach

### Team Name:  
`EchoMind`

### Team Members:  
- Name 1: Prem Dubay ([Github](https://github.com/MasterPrem001) / [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prem-dubay-master) / Role(Fullstack Dev) 

### Your Approach:  
Why I chose this problem:
I chose this problem because, in today's world, staying up-to-date with news can be overwhelming. The constant influx of information makes it difficult to find relevant and concise news. People often struggle to filter out the noise and focus on what truly matters to them. By using Groq's AI and compound-beta, I saw an opportunity to simplify the news consumption process, tailoring it to individual preferences while saving time and energy.

Key challenges I addressed:
One of the key challenges was aggregating reliable and timely news from multiple sources and presenting it in a concise format. Another challenge was ensuring the system’s ability to adapt to user preferences, delivering highly relevant news based on location and topic of interest. Additionally, integrating Groq’s compound-beta AI system was crucial to providing accurate and up-to-date information through intelligent tool use like web search and code execution.

Any pivots, brainstorms, or breakthroughs during hacking:
During the development, there was a moment when I realized the need for a more dynamic and responsive AI system that could deliver real-time news updates while maintaining accuracy and relevance. This led to the decision to integrate Groq's compound-beta, which was a breakthrough in allowing the system to perform multiple web searches and code executions simultaneously, previously i was thinking of using other methods to web scrape the news and use grok models to intrigate it.
