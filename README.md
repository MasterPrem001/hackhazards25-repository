## 📌 Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 1:**  
*Weave AI magic with Groq*

---

## 🎯 Objective

This project addresses the issue of information overload by delivering personalized, real-time news summaries based on individual preferences.  
In today’s fast-paced world, keeping up with the sheer volume of news can be overwhelming, and sifting through multiple sources to find what's relevant takes up valuable time.

This tool caters to anyone seeking to stay informed without spending excessive time, be it professionals, students, or casual readers wanting to stay current on specific topics.

By using Groq’s compound-beta AI, which integrates web search and code execution tools, the system delivers accurate, up-to-date news in a concise format.  
With advanced Llama models for precise responses, it provides an ideal solution for users wanting to stay informed while avoiding information overload.

Whether you're a professional or someone who enjoys curated content, this tool helps save time by delivering only the most relevant news.

### Your Approach

**Why I chose this problem:**  
I chose this problem because, in today's world, staying up-to-date with news can be overwhelming. The constant influx of information makes it difficult to find relevant and concise news.  
People often struggle to filter out the noise and focus on what truly matters to them.  
By using Groq's AI and compound-beta, I saw an opportunity to simplify the news consumption process, tailoring it to individual preferences while saving time and energy.

**Key challenges I addressed:**  
- Aggregating reliable and timely news from multiple sources and presenting it concisely.
- Adapting to user preferences (location/topic based).
- Integrating Groq’s compound-beta AI for intelligent web search and code execution.

**Pivots, brainstorms, or breakthroughs:**  
Initially, I considered web scraping for news aggregation, but later realized Groq's compound-beta could deliver much better real-time results.  
Switching to Groq was a key breakthrough for dynamic updates and multi-tool execution.
